# Stock Analysis Script
This README file provides an overview of the Stockanalysis script, detailing its functionality, the logic behind it, and how it processes the data to produce the desired outputs.
# Overview
The Stockanalysis script is a VBA macro designed to loop through multiple worksheets in an Excel workbook, process stock data, and generate a summary of quarterly changes for each stock ticker. It calculates the quarterly change, percentage change, and total stock volume, and highlights positive and negative changes with conditional formatting. Additionally, it identifies and displays the greatest percentage increase, decrease, and total volume for each stock.
## Crafting the Solution
My goal was clear: create a script that would loop through each worksheet, process the stock data, and output the summarized results in a neat and organized manner.
First, I needed to set up my tools. I initialized variables to store the ticker symbols, volumes, opening and closing prices, quarterly changes, and percentage changes. These variables would be my trusty companions throughout the journey.


## The Great Loop Begins
Next, I crafted a loop to go through each worksheet. For each worksheet, I set up headers in the summary table. These headers would guide the output of my results: "Ticker", "Quarterly change", "Percent Change", and "Total Stock Volume".


## Diving Into the Data
The next step was to loop through the rows of data. I needed to calculate the quarterly change and percentage change for each ticker, and sum the total volume. This required careful navigation through the data, identifying when a new ticker started and ended.


## Adding Some Color
To make the results more visually appealing and easier to interpret, I decided to use conditional formatting. Positive changes would be highlighted in green and negative changes in red. This visual aid would help quickly identify trends and anomalies.



## The Final Touches
I knew my script wouldn't be complete without identifying the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume. These key metrics would provide valuable insights into stock performance. I added the final piece of code to uncover these treasures and display them prominently.
